# Abstract {.unnumbered}

## Culture condition and experimental setup {.unnumbered}

Two non-axenic PhycoCyanin(PC)-rich (CCBA_056 or CCBA_077) and two PhycoErythrin(PE)-rich (CCBA_048 or CCBA_127) strains of *Synechococcus* were obtained from Culture Collection of Baltic Algae (CCBA; https://ccba.ug.edu.pl/pages/en/home.php). Pre-cultures of picocyanobacteria strains were kept in Tissue Culture Flasks (VWR International, Cat. No. 10062-872, PA, USA) and were transferred to fresh f/2 media [@guillardCulturePhytoplanktonFeeding1975] at salinity of 8 PSU every two weeks, under a photoperiod of 12 h and Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) of 10 µmol photons m^−2^s^−1^ supplied from cool white fluorescent tubes, at 22℃.

Cultures of each strain were grown in 8 x 80 mL round bottom glass tubes in a Multi-Cultivator MC 1000-OD (Photon Systems Instruments, Drásov, Czech Republic). Each culture tube contained 75 mL of f/2 medium inoculated with and 5 mL of growing pre-culture, to achieve exponential growth from the beginning of the experiment, with little to no lag phase upon inoculation. 

Cultures grew at 22℃, with photoperiods of 8, 12, 16, or 24 h, with peak Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) of 30, 90, 180, 300, 600, or 900 µmol photons m^−2^s^−1^ supplied from white LED lamps independently to each culture tube. To reflect the natural movement of the sun, the photoperiods of 8-16 h were applied in the shape of a sine wave, while the 24-hour photoperiod was applied in a square shape. Since the area under a sine curve is 1/2 the area under a square of equal width, the 24 h square photoperiod cultures received 4 times the diel photon dose of the 12 h sine photoperiod cultures.
 
The cultures of picocyanobacteria were acclimatized for one day to the new conditions corresponding to the incubation conditions of the proper culture. Tubes contained Glass Aeration Tubes and were closed with a silicone inert stopper perforated by an aeration input tube extending to the bottom of the culture tube, and a pressure outlet tube. Aeration with a total air flow rate of around 1,100 mL min^−1^ distributed across 8 tubes for ~ 140 mL min^−1^ tube^−1^ ensures mixing and provides sufficient air/CO~2~ supply to cultures across the entire culture volume. Cultivation and monitoring functions (light, temperature, optical density, and aeration gas) of the Multi-Cultivator system was controlled via the Photobioreactor Control Software (Photon Systems Instruments, Drásov, Czech Republic). 

## The growth curve and chlorophyll specific exponential growth rate analysis {.unnumbered}

Picocyanobacterial growth was monitored every 5 minutes by automatically recording OD~680~, OD~720~, and ΔOD (ΔOD = OD~680~-OD~720~) for 14 days, independently for each culture tube. The exceptions were experiments conducted with a photoperiod of 24 h and light of 600 or 900 µmol photons m^−2^s^−1^, which lasted 7 days.

Based on the obtained measurements of growth we determined exponential chlorophyll specific exponential growth rate (µ) by fitting logistic growth curves to plots of the chlorophyll *a* proxy of ΔOD vs. elapsed time for each combination of strain, photoperiod, and peak PAR. We used a modified Levenberg-Marquardt fitting algorithm [@minpack.lm].

## The growth symmetry analysis {.unnumbered}

xxxx Add proper text here Sylwia!!!

Using the 5-minute time interval, the absolute growth increment (AGI) was computed, defined as the OD680 change between the consecutive measurements d(OD680)/dt. Values above 0 represent OD680 increase and growth of the picocyanobacteria cultures. Increase of the AGI curve reflects acceleration of the growth, and decrease the deceleration phase, consequently (Fig. 1).

Based on the AGI were determined the acceleration phase length (AccLen), defined as the time (expressed in h) between the start of the photoperiod and the time of the tMaxDGI. This relationship was defined as diel growth symmetry (GS; Eq. (1)).
GS(h)=AccLen/(Photoperiod length)  (1)
The maximum value within each photoperiod was called the maximum daily growth increment (maxDGI), and the highest of all of them, was recorded for each experiment setup and referred to as the maximum absolute growth increment (maxAGI). The maxAGI marked the point of the sigmoid curve fitted to the growth curve, indicating the transition point leading to the pre-stationary phase. Additionally, the total daily growth (TDG), defined as the difference in OD680 at the end and at the beginning of each photoperiod was estimated.

## Determining the number of cells {.unnumbered}

The number of picocyanobacterial cells was calculated using linear regression models based on cell concentration (N mL^−1^) and OD at 680 nm. The OD of cultures was measured using a CLARIOstar Plus Plate Reader (BMG, Labtech, Ortenberg, Germany) and calculation of the cell number was conducted using the PAMAS S40 GO Particle counter (PAMAS Partikelmess- und Analysesysteme GmbH, Rutesheim, Germany). The linear correlations between N and OD~680~ for individual strains were used to estimate the number of cells based on OD measurements obtained from Multi-Cultivator system. Linear regression, coefficient of determination, Pearson correlation coefficients, and p-value was presented in Tab. S1 (Supplementary materials).

Calculation of the absorption cross section of PSII photochemistry (\u03C3~PSII~'; nm^2^ quanta^-1^) under ambient light through an iterative curve fit to the saturation phase of an Fast Repetition Rate fluorometry (FRRf) single turnover (ST) measurement of tested picocyanobacteria were obtained using SoliSense laser-induced fluorescence transient (LIFT) fluorometer equipped with a prototype temperature control unit (LIFT-REM, Soliense Inc., New York, USA). PSII flux per unit volume (JV~PSII~; xxxx add proper unit) was calculated according to the method proposed by [Campbell?; Oxborough et al., 2012]. 

PC-rich and PE-rich picocyanobacteria were measured under diel peak PAR growth light under a blue LED (Ex 445 nm) and orange (Ex 590 nm) excitation. Excitation protocols were used to manipulate the level of photosynthetic activity and chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF). Flash Power for blue excitation was 60000 and for orange excitation was 14000 µmol photons m^−2^s^−1^. The intensity of the blue and orange LIFT LED in DC mode and excitation power were calibrated using a quantum sensor (LI-250, LI-COR, Inc.). Data were collected during an rapid light curve (RLC) sequence during which light intensity was increased from 0 to 320 µmol photons m^−2^s^−1^ and then decreased from 320 to 0 µmol photons m^−2^s^−1^ with a 1-s pause in darkness between measurements. Acquisitions were made at 10-s intervals. [Campbell and Kolber?; Kolber et al., 2005; Oxborough et al., 2012].

## Statistical analysis {.unnumbered}

All analysis of obtained results was conducted using R version 4.3.0 [@rcoreteamLanguageEnvironmentStatistical2019] running under RStudio [@teamrstudio.RStudioIntegratedDevelopment2015]. To determine significant differences in studied experiments the “stats” v. 3.6.2 R standard packages were used. This package provides basic statistical functions, including the *lm()* function for linear regression, *aov()* function for ANOVA, and *t.test()* function for t-test. 

Linear regression, coefficient of determination (R square), Pearson correlation coefficients (R), and p-value was used to calculate the number of cells (N mL^−1^) and  pigment content (µg mL^-1^) for two PhycoCyanin(PC)-rich cultures (056, 077) and two PhycoErythrin(PE)-rich cultures (048, 127) of *Synechococcus* sp. originating from the Baltic Sea. 

We performed three-way factorial ANOVA of chlorophyll specific exponential growth rate, estimated from logistic fits of chlorophyll proxy OD~680~-OD~720~, index of diel growth symmetry, and effective absorption cross section of PSII (\u03C3~PSII~'; nm^2^ quanta^-1^) measured under diel peak PAR growth light under Ex445 nm (blue) or under Ex590 nm (orange) excitation in relation to the cumulative diel photon dose (µmol photons m^−2^d^−1^) or in relation to the total Phyco/Chl *a* ratio.

To examine statistical differences between models, we performed one-way ANOVA of a three parameter model (Harrison and Platt, 1986) from pooled data and data fit across different photoperiods (8, 12, 16, or 24) or data fit across different peak PAR (30, 90, 180, 300, 600 together with 900) from chlorophyll specific exponential growth rate, for two PhycoCyanin(PC)-rich cultures (056, 077) and two PhycoErythrin(PE)-rich cultures (048, 127) of *Synechococcus* sp. originating from the Baltic Sea, grown at 30, 90, 180, 300, 600, or 900 peak PAR µmol photons m^−2^s^−1^; and photoperiods of 8, 12, 16, or 24 h. 

One-way ANOVA was also used to examine statistical differences between single phase exponential decay fit model of pooled data across different strains for a given phase of growth and across different phase of growth for a given strain from index of diel growth symmetry; (AccLen/DecLen ratio), PUR/PAR ratio, total Phyco/Chl *a* ratio, and effective absorption cross section of PSII (\u03C3~PSII~'; nm^2^ quanta^-1^) measured under diel peak PAR growth light under Ex590 nm (orange) excitation in relation to the cumulative diel photon dose (µmol photons m^−2^d^−1^).

T-test of linear fit model of pooled data across different strains for a given phase of growth and across different phase of growth for a given strain from effective absorption cross section of PSII (\u03C3~PSII~'; nm^2^ quanta^-1^) measured under diel peak PAR growth light under Ex445 nm (blue) excitation in relation to the cumulative diel photon dose (µmol photons m^−2^d^−1^) or in relation to the total Phyco/Chl *a* ratio, as well as from effective absorption cross section of PSII (\u03C3~PSII~'; nm^2^ quanta^-1^) measured under diel peak PAR growth light under Ex590 nm (orange) excitation in relation to the total Phyco/Chl *a* ratio was performed.

The *SSasymp()* function (Self-Starting Nls Asymptotic Regression Model) was used to perform a single phase exponential decay fit model. A modified Levenberg-Marquardt fitting algorithm [@minpack.lm] was used for estimating logistic fits of chlorophyll proxy OD~680~-OD~720~ vs. elapsed time for each combination of strain, photoperiod, and peak PAR. The trends of change in the growth symmetry (GS) were tested using the Mann-Kendall test [@toutenburgHollanderWolfeNonparametric1975] on the ±5 photoperiods to avoid noise during the first few days of the experiment. Statistical differences for all analyzes were determined at the level of significance \u03B1 = 0.05.

## Changes of diel growth symmetry {.unnumbered}
Supplemental figures show consistent variations in short term growth rates over diel cycles.  We sought to analyze the intra-diel patterns of growth, initially by separating growth over the photoperiod into an acclerating phase of increasing hourly growth increments, and a deceleration phase, of decreasing hourly growth increments.

Research Question:
Do strains show consistent patterns of diel growth across cumulative diel photon doses?

No.
The length of the diel acceleration phase of growth increases with increasing photoperiod, but the slope of accleration phase vs. cumulative diel photon dose decreases with increasing peak PAR. 

During pre-stationary phase these responses dampen but persist.

Research Question:
Do strains show consistent patterns of diel symmetry (AccLen/DecLen) across cumulative diel photon doses?

Yes.
The ratio of the diel acceleration phase of growth to the deceleration phase shows a consistent exponential decay in relation to cumulative photon dose, across different combinations of photoperiod and peak PAR.
Although all strains shows this response pattern, the exponential decay model parameters differ significantly among strains.
During pre-stationary phase this response dampens and even disappears.
